# Expense_Tracker_v1
This version was created for a university project to test my skills with APIs. For this project, we developed an API capable of managing expenses, incomes, and their respective categories. I chose PostgreSQL for the database schema because of its simplicity and ease of use. For the frontend, I chose React; however, I didnâ€™t explore it much in this version. In the future, we plan to explore and implement more features to scale the application, apply and practice newly learned concepts, and further engage with the frontend, which I explored less in this version.
